Welcome to my new personal website! This platform will serve as a hub for sharing my research, projects, and thoughts on information science, AI, and German literature.

## What to Expect

I'll be regularly updating this site with:

- Research findings and academic papers
- Projects I'm working on at Columbia and beyond
- Thoughts on emerging technologies and design
- Interesting connections between technology and linguistics

Stay tuned for more content coming soon!

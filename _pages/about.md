## Education

I'm a recent graduate from Columbia University:
- **BA in Information Science** with a focus on computational linguistics, with courses in Syntax, Discourse Analysis, NLP, AI and NLU, and Data Visualization
- **Concentration in German Literature and Cultural History** focusing on early 20th literature and philosophy with particular interest in the intersection between language, politics, and technology (Benjamin, Heidegger, and Adorno)

## Research Interests

My academic work bridges technology and humanities through several key areas:

### Computational Linguistics
I explore how NLP can enhance our understanding of linguistic patterns across different languages, with particular emphasis on German political texts. My previous research focused on exploring cross-linguistic patterns in political discourse, analyzing how political parties differentiate themselves through particular collocations and lexical choices.

### Fordism
During a junior year pro-seminar at the Free University of Berlin, I studied the historical and cultural implications of Fordism, particularly its arrival in Germany during the interwar period. This research examined how Fordism influenced labor relations and political discourse, shaping the country's socio-economic development in a time of extensive upheaval.

### Information Architecture
I study how information can be structured, organized, and presented to maximize its utility and accessibility. This interest extends to both digital and physical spaces, including libraries, databases, and knowledge management systems. I am particularly interested in ontologies and formal concptual modeling, exploring how these frameworks can enhance our understanding of complex information systems.

## Technical Skills

- **Programming Languages**: Python, C, C++, Java, R, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, SQL

## Personal Interests

When I'm not in the lab or library, you might find me:
- Exploring NYC's art galleries and museums
- Hiking in the Hudson Valley
- Reading Walter Benjamin in Central Park
- Taking [photographs](https://adm2216.myportfolio.com/) of friends

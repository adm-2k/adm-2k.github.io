Welcome to my portfolio! Here you'll find selected projects that demonstrate my skills and interests at the intersection of information science, AI, and linguistic research. Each project includes an overview, methodologies used, and outcomes.

## Featured Projects

The projects below represent my work across several domains:

- **AI & Machine Learning Applications** - Implementations of neural networks and other ML algorithms for various problem domains
- **Natural Language Processing Systems** - Tools and research focused on computational linguistics and language understanding
- **Data Visualization & Analysis** - Interactive visualizations and analytical systems for complex datasets

## Academic vs. Applied

My portfolio includes both academic research projects with rigorous methodology and practical applications designed to solve real-world problems. I believe in bridging theoretical understanding with practical implementation.

## Collaboration

Many projects shown here were completed in collaboration with fellow researchers, professors, or industry partners. I value collaborative work and believe diverse perspectives strengthen outcomes. Collaborative contributions are noted in individual project descriptions.

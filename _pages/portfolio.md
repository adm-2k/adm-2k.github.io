Welcome to my portfolio! Here you'll find selected projects that demonstrate my skills and interests at the intersection of information science, UX/UI, and linguistic research. Each project includes an overview, methodologies used, and outcomes.

## Featured Projects

The projects below represent my work across several domains:

- **AI & Machine Learning Applications** - Implementations of neural networks and other ML algorithms for various NLP projects
- **NLP and CompLing Research** - Academic research focused on applying NLP techniques to various text corpora, including sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and language modeling via graphs
- **Data Visualization & Analysis** - Interactive visualizations and analysis of data for various courses
- **UX/UI Design** - User-centered design projects from my work at the [Columbia Daily Spectator](https://www.columbiaspectator.com/) ([TheShaft](https://theshaft.info/), [LionClubs](https://www.columbiaspectator.com/spectrum/2021/06/08/lionclubs-columbias-new-go-to-streamlined-club-database/), [CULPA](https://culpa.info/)) that focus on student needs and experiences

## Academic vs. Applied

My portfolio includes both academic research projects with rigorous methodology and practical applications designed to solve real-world problems. I believe in bridging theoretical understanding with practical implementation.

## Collaboration

Many projects shown here were completed in collaboration with fellow researchers and professors. I value collaborative work and believe diverse perspectives strengthen outcomes. Collaborative contributions are noted in individual project descriptions, as well as below:
